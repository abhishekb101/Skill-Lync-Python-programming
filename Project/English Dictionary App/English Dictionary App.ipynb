    "*This project uses the skills learnt from week 1 to week 6. The aim of this project is to create an English Dictionary app that returns definitions of English words. When the application is started, it displays a menu as follows:*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Menu:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a new word\n",
    "- Find the meaning\n",
    "- Update a word\n",
    "- Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enter Choice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*If item 1 is selected, it should prompt for a word and then accept its meaning. This pair of word and its meaning should be stored in a file called ‘words.txt’. When item 2 is selected, it should prompt for a word, search that word in the file ‘words.txt’ and return the meaning if it is found. If the meaning is not found, it should display an appropriate message. Similarly, when choice 3 is entered, it should accept a word and update its meaning. In all the above three cases, the prompt should return to the main menu. The words and their meanings should be stored as a dictionary in words.txt, using the concept of serialization. If choice 4 is selected, a graceful exit should be performed.*"
